1 created angular cli at cmd (19.0.2) cmd: npm install -g @angular/cli@19.0.2
2 created component (ng generate component name)
3 import newly created component at app.component.ts
4 tweak their component.ts
5 personally chose tailwindcss rather vanilla css (but both can be implemented)
6 added button (still figure out how to redirect)


note:
its a good practice to use signals(), when implementing dynamics
